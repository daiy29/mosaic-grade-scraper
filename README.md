# Mosaic Mark Scraper

Mosaic Mark Scraper is a simple script made in Python that periodically checks the McMaster website every 60 seconds and sends the user an e-mail if there are updates.

## Usage

Save the scraper.py file, cd into it's directory.
The script can be run with ./scraper.py <arg1> <arg2> <arg3> <arg4>, where
- <arg1> should be replaced by your Mosaic username
- <arg2> should be replaced by your Mosaic password
- <arg3> should be replaced by your Gmail username
- <arg4> should be replaced by your Gmail password

Prior to using the script, critical security alerts for less secure apps on Gmail should be disabled. Instructions can be found [here](https://hotter.io/docs/email-accounts/secure-app-gmail/), under the second category.
